# TensorFlow Classification Model for Breast Cancer Detection
This project implements a TensorFlow classification model to distinguish between malignant and benign cancer cases in a provided dataset. The model utilizes MobileNet v2, a pre-trained model stored on TensorFlow Hub, for transfer learning.

To leverage the model's potential in real-world scenarios, we further explore by converting it into a TensorFlow Lite model. This allows deployment on mobile and embedded devices with limited resources, opening possibilities for further development and application.

This repository includes the code for both models, along with scripts for:
1. Training the TensorFlow model
2. Evaluating both models performance
